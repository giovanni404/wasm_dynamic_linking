# wasm_dynamic_linking

WebAssembly (WASM) Dynamic Linking using **Emscripten**.[^1])

## Background

Three options are available for dynamic linking when using Emscripten with C or C++ source code:[^2]

1. Manually link to a WASM module by using the ```dlopen``` function in your C or C++ source code.
2. Instruct Emscripten that there are WASM modules to link to by specifying them in the ```dynamicLibraries``` array of Emscriptenâ€™s generated JavaScript source code. When Emscripten instantiates the WebAssembly module, it will automatically download and link modules that are specified in this array.
3. Manually take the exports of one module and pass them in as imports to another using the WebAssembly JavaScript API in your JavaScript source code.

## Purpose

While the purpose of this repository is to show how to build a WASM application that links to its WASM modules dynamically at run time - first we'll look at how to statically link the WASM modules to the WASM application at time of build, for comparison purposes. Option #2, using the ```dynamicLibraries``` array, may be the ideal method to use when compiling existing C or C++ code to WASM as it doesn't require altering the existing source code in a major way - only this method is describe below.

## Main Project Files

1. main.c - WASM application
2. foo1.c - WASM module
3. foo2.c - WASM module
4. pre.js - Contains the list of WASM modules that need to be preloaded (for dynamic linking to at run time) when the WASM application runs in a Web Browser

**Note:** The types of files produced as output from the Emscripten Compiler Frontend depend on the flags[^3] and the name of the specified output file[^4] passed to ```emcc```. 

## Create a standalone WASM application containing WASM modules statically linked at build time:

### For running in a WASI Runtime (e.g., **wasmtime**)

```
$emcc main.c foo1.c foo2.c -o main.wasm
```

As this generates only a WASM file, we can run it in wasi-supporting runtimes, such as **wasmtime**:

```
$wasmtime main.wasm 
hello world 3
```

### For running in a Web Browser (e.g., **Chrome**)

```
$emcc main.c foo1.c foo2.c -o main.html
```

In this case the generated WASM file depends on a JavaScript Engine for execution. Run the HTML and WASM files using a Web Browser like **Chrome**:

```
$emrun main.html --browser "/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/"chrome.exe
```

#### Web Browser Output

## Create a WASM application and the WASM modules it needs to link to (independantly of each other):

### For running in a WASI Runtime (e.g., **wasmtime**)

**wasi-sdk** - The WASI-enabled WebAssembly C/C++ toolchain does not yet support dynamic libraries.[^5]

### For running in a Web Browser (e.g., **Chrome**)

```
$emcc foo1.c -s SIDE_MODULE=1 -o foo1.wasm
$emcc foo2.c -s SIDE_MODULE=1 -o foo2.wasm
```

These SIDE_MODULE can be dynamically linked to the WASM application a.k.a. MAIN_MODULE, in two ways:

1. Dynamically link WASM modules to WASM application at load time

```
$emcc main.c -s MAIN_MODULE=1 foo1.wasm foo2.wasm -o main.html
```

2. Dynamically link WASM modules to WASM application at run time

```
$emcc main.c -s MAIN_MODULE=1 -s ERROR_ON_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS=0 --pre-js pre.js -o main.html
```

In both cases, the generated WASM file depends on a JavaScript Engine for execution. Run the HTML and WASM files using a Web Browser like **Chrome**:

```
$emrun main.html --browser "/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/"chrome.exe
```

#### Web Browser Output

**Note:** In both cases, Web Browser output should be identical to that of the standalone WASM application (shown above), however for dynamic linking at run time to work, the modified main.js source code with the list of 'dynamicLibraries' to preload, must successfully execute!
